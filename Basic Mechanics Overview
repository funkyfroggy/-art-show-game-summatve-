Let's go over the required mechanics again: 
--
1. Use of scene management(1)
User will interact with a variety of friends in different locations.
-
2. Multiple instances of user interaction(1)
Choose from a variety of options for actions and dialogue.

3. Data collection(scoring) (1)
your quality of relationship will be visibly measured in "heart ponts".

4. A goal oriented mission (a clear objective for the user) (1)
Goal is to form healthy friendships with the characters.

5. Object Oriented principles demonstrated (1)
Points relate to level of success toward the goal.

6. Using a workflow for programming and refactoring the code(khanacademy, p5.js online editor, GitHub pages)(1)
Github.

7. Hosting your media on GitHub pages (1)
check.

8. Originality(some feature that is specifically created by you and that you claim is completely your own idea)(1)
heart points are not typically measured visibly in the visual novel game style.

9. Use of version control(saving multiple versions, this is best done using Github, but multiple versions can be saved using KA or p5.js) (1)
Github, check.

10. Comments in the code to describe: -What certain portions of the code do -Where certain portions of the code have been taken from (1)
got it.
